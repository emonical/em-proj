# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-16)

**Core value:** A sub-agent, skill, or session can ask the substrate "is it safe to edit X, or is someone else working there?" and get a structured, parseable answer grounded in current cross-session reality.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Test Harness + Redis Foundation (not yet started)

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Test Harness + Redis Foundation)
Plan: — (phase not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-05-17 — Roadmap created; 24 v1 REQ-IDs mapped across 6 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Backend = persistent Redis (drives Phase 1 infra work and all later primitives)
- Stack = Python 3.12+ via uv (drives Phase 2 CLI shape)
- Lock default = block-with-1s-timeout, `--warn` opt-in (drives Phase 3 LOCK-02)
- Claim model added to M1 alongside lock (drives Phase 4 in its entirety)
- Multi-process test harness as first M1 deliverable (drives Phase 1 ordering — harness before any locking code)
- gsd-sdk integration via shell-out, not source extension (drives Phase 6 boundary)
